    <h1>OUR MENU</h1>

        <div>
            <p>Chicken</p>
            <p>
                Each section should have a section title region that is always positioned at the top right corner of the
                section no matter the view (desktop, tablet or mobile). Copy the titles from the mockup illustration
                (i.e., Chicken, Beef, Sushi) or come up with your own. (Hint: use relative and absolute positioning and
                offsets as discussed in Lecture 22.)
